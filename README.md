# Linear Algebra and Learning from Data
MATLAB exercises from the course "Linear Algebra and Learning from Data" taken at Stockholm University

The course had three exercises to be done which gave an overview over some basic machine learning.

- Project 1: Singular value decomposition and classification of handwritten numbers
- Project 2: Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify sonar and radar data
- Project 3: Deep Learning with different amounts of layers and different activation functions
